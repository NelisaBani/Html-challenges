     <h1><u>The road to becoming a web developer</u></h1>


     <p>Growing up I have always loved playing computer games but I actualy never thought of taking anything related to I.T as a career, I was more into drawing and dramatic arts that even in high school I did exceptionally well in Visual Arts and Dramatic Arts but ended up carrying on with only Dramatic Arts from grade 10-12, and never even considered choosing CAT/IT as one of the subject I would carry on with till grade 12.<p>
    <p>When I heard about coding(web developing and designing, UX designing) for the first time I was like, "okay no, this career field is not for me at all" becuase I actually thought coding was for "nerds" and people who did comuter studies and pure maths. I had non of those but funny enough I did some research on coding and I felt that I would like to explore and actually come out of my comfort zone and try out somethimg new.</p>
    <p>One day my mother came home with a <em>"Life Choices"</em> and<em> "CodeSpace"</em> pamphlet advertising a coding course that was for 6months and 6months intern work in coding. I was genuinly excited about this oppotunity becuase that meant I will finally get out of my comfort zone and do something completely different from what I am used to. I applied immediately for the course.
    A few weeks after I have applied for the course I received an email from <em>Life Choices</em> and I was required to write an online aptitude test from <em>CodeSpace</em> and I actually passed the test, I know this because I was contacted and I was told that I had made it to the next step of going to the one day boot camp and the boot camp is for those who passed the aptitude online test. I was really excited about all this and I was really proud of myself. I went throght to the next stage which was <b>Life skills</b> that was for two weeks and after that you are told if you have made it through to the actual <b>coding course</b>, and guess what! I MADE IT THROUGH!. receiving the news that I have made it through to the course was really awesome for mean it meant a lot to me that I even cried (well it was tears of joy) but at the same time I was also nervous of what is to come, because i had no computer background so I knew nothing about codes i only knew what I researched which is only careers you can get from coding and that was it.</p>
    <p>the course started and we wewe taught how to code and wow!! I actually enjoyed it ery much , I even started calling myself a "junior dev", this was one of the prodest moments of my life, I have to say.</p>
